# Overview

The purpose of this repo is to gather all the general assets, rules and resources for the design and branding process in one place.

Within this `README`, the repository index aims to briefly lay out what the different folders are for and there are also some short sections below discussing some of the main asset types. There is also a further section below outlining some important brand information.

### Brand Guide
Our brand guide is the definitive source of information and guidance on how to use the assets you find in this repository. Before you begin using the assets here, it is highly recommended to have a quick read of this document to get a sense of the rules and best practices for each asset type.

Our brand guide can be found [here](brand-guide/branding.pdf).

### Logo

Our logo is perhaps the most important asset from a branding perspective. We have a number of different types of logo available for use (emblem, wordmark, icon etc.) in a number of different color schemes so it is important to follow the rules for the particular variant of the logo you are using. All of these rules can be found in the brand guide mentioned earlier.

### Illustrations
We have designed a number of illustrations which can be used in various situations. They are probably most appropriate for communications with our stakeholders. These communications can take the form of blog posts, press releases, social media posts, newsletters and more.

### Social Media
The `/social-media` folder in this repo contains all of the assets necessary for our social media accounts. These include cover images for profile pages as well as cover images for blog posts etc.

### Source Files
Source material (in the form of Adobe Illustrator and Sketch files) can be found in the `/source` folder. This is unlikely to be useful for the typical visitor to this repository, but will probably be very helpful for designers.

### Other Assets
There are a selection of other assets available in this repository which do not warrant their own description yet as they are not needed yet. More information will be added on these assets and their usage rules in the future!

<i>We believe that art, be it as literature, music, film, games or performance, is a critical tool through which societies establish a shared understanding of what is common knowledge among all members. These expressions define values and narratives that end up shaping culture, faith and even public policy. It therefore matters deeply how it is financed, distributed and paid for...</i>
